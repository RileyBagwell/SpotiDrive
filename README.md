# SpotiDrive
SpotiDrive allows you to input your starting address and destination, and it will automatically calculate the estimated drive time for your trip, and provide you with a customized Spotify playlist to match the length of your trip!

This is a project for the HackUTD X hackathon by Riley Bagwell and Daniel Nemirovskiy. We utilized the Spotify and MapQuest APIs, and the entirety of the codebase is written in Python. Django is the front-end framework for the app.
